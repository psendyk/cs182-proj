# Testing
You need to run "pip install -r requirements.txt", then "python test_submission.py [eval.csv]" where [eval.csv] is your file with columns: Image_id (int), image_path (str), image_height (int), image_width (int), image_channels (int). This will produce a file eval_classified.csv containing an id and predicted class for each image.
